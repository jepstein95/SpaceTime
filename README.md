# SpaceTime

A [binary clock](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spacetime27/spacetime.html) that is only moderately hard to read!

This clock operates on an 8 hour cycle (rather than 12 or 24), which means that cycles start at Midnight, 8AM and 4PM. The smallest circle is the One-hand, the medium circle is the Two-hand and the large circle is the Four-hand. Hands on the dark half of the clock are "on," and those that are on the light half are "off". The sum of all hands that are "on" equals the number of hours past the beginning of the current cycle. The One-hand makes a full revolution once every two hours, and its progress around the clock face can be used to estimate the number of minutes past the hour.
